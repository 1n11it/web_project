# Yatra Project
## travel website

I've created a travel website with three main pages: home, explore, and signup. 
On homepage you're greeted with a small animation that adds a bit of flair, moving from top to bottom to reveal a stunning image of mountains. 
But here's the kicker - I've added a parallax effect to the mountains, so when you hover over them with your mouse, 
they move in attractive and playful way. It's really smooth and adds a whole new level of interactivity.
In the navigation, you'll find options to explore and sign up. The explore page is where things get interesting. 
I've borrowed the same interactive feature I used in my minimalist product webpage, so you can browse through various destinations. 
Clicking on an image reveals a new place with a bit of info to entice you. 
I've included a total of 6 places to give users plenty of options to explore.
And then there's the signup page, complete with a form and images representing the travel agency or organization.
