# Minimalist
## Product presentation website

A sleek platform designed to showcase products or services in a minimalist and elegant way. 
It's crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript libraries, which allowed me to achieve a modern and professional design. 
One of the cool things about it is the hover animations on the images, which add a dynamic touch to the browsing experience. 
I've also kept the text on the site minimal and to the point for a clean look.
One feature I'm particularly proud of is the secondary page. 
When you click on it, there's a smooth slide-up animation that reveals a new page, giving it a really polished feel. 
I've included different images of influencers on each page to add some visual interest and personality.
Another thing I've done is provide a template format, so users can customize the product page to their needs. 
I think this adds a lot of value because it makes the site more versatile and user-friendly.
