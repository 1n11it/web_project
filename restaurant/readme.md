## restaurant website

A restaurant website using HTML and CSS, aiming for a professional and attractive appearance. 
With six main options - home, about, category, menu, review, and contact.
In terms of design, the website boasts a sleek and modern aesthetic, 
complemented by subtle animations to add personality without overwhelming the user experience.
The "home" sets the stage with an inviting layout, incorporating subtle animations to enhance user engagement. 
The "about" section tells the restaurant's story, while "category" and "menu" display dishes attractively. 
"Review" gathers customer feedback, and "contact" provides essential information for inquiries.
In essence, the restaurant website I crafted serves as a digital ambassador, 
enticing visitors with its captivating design and intuitive functionality while 
showcasing the restaurant's unique offerings and inviting them to embark on a culinary journey.
